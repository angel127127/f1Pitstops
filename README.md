# F1Pitstops
This repository contains my projects utilising the FastF1 library in Python. 


Projects:

- fastf1SilverstoneQualifyingGraphs.ipynb -  Python data analysis project using FastF1 and Matplotlib.
      - Compares qualifying times for the top 10 drivers
      - Analyses telemetry (speed vs distance) of the top 3 qualifiers
      - Tools: FastF1, Matplotlib, Pandas, Google Colab, MATLAB

- fastf1QualifyingGraphs - this project takes the .ipynb code and adds a GUI. Gives the user the ability to select a race and year to view data on qualifying.
